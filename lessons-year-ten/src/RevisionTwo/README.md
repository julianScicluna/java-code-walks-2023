# Revision 2

A little bit more practice.

## Problem: SimpleCalculator

We will be completing a program that performs the most basic arithmetic functions:
- Sum of two numbers (a + b)
- Subtraction of two numbers (a - b)
- Multiplication of two numbers (a * b)
- Division of two numbers (a / b)

The program will accept from the user an operator e.g. '+' and two numbers. Depending on the operator, the program will perform the function and display the result.

<b>Instructions:</b>
- Create a new folder under the `src` folder named `RevisionTwo`.
- Create a new file under `RevisionTwo` and name it `SimpleCalculator.java`.
- Copy the code of `SimpleCalculator.java`.
- Work on all the commented tasks labelled as `TODO`.

## Revision Checklist
- Expressions involving arithmetic operations
- Switch case statement
