# Revision 1

We all get rusty if we do not practice regularly. Before we jump on to the new stuff we need to do a warm-up and reacquaint ourselves with Java. The best way to get practice is to solve interesting problems.

## Problem: Cinema Ticket Price

We will be completing a program that displays the cost of one cinema ticket based on the age inputted by the user. If the user is 12 or over then the adult's fee of $11.50 applies, otherwise the children's fee of $5.50.

<b>Instructions:</b>
- Create two new folders under the `src` folder named `Helpers` and `RevisionOne`.
- Copy the `Keyboard.java` file and place it under the `Helpers` folder.
- Create a new file under `RevisionOne` and name it `CinemaTicket.java`.
- Copy the code of `CinemaTicket.java`.
- Work on all the commented tasks labelled as `TODO`.

## Revision Checklist
- Adding comments to a program.
- Declare variables and constants of simple data types.
- Assign values to variables and constants.
- Accept user input using the `Keyboard` class.
- Make use of conditional statements to branch logic.
- Display output.
