Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) Code is a free coding editor that can be used for coding in *any* programming language and we are going to use it to continue to learn how to program in Java. 

Today we will get you set-up and ready to go! The sky is the limit here. Feel free to make the tool *work for you*. Many helpful tools can be installed on it, and during the lessons you can decide whether this powerful editor is the right one for you.

I certainly loves it and to me it feels like home. To learn more about how to set-up Visual Studio Code at home read my <a href="https://erikacamilleri.wixsite.com/bytesizelearning/post/setting-up-your-development-environment">blog post</a>.

## To Do List
