## Santa Parcel Delivery

Santa needs a program to check the size and weight of parcels to determine which can be accepted to deliver on Christmas Eve. 

There are three tasks to complete, one is easy, the other is a little harder, and the last one is most difficult! Only experienced programmers can help with the last one!

But we are in luck, we can do this challenge to help Santa **together**.

### Task 1 - Check the size and weight of one parcel (EASY)

Input and store the weight and dimensions for one parcel. All the dimensions (l, b, h) and the weight must be *validated* on entry and an unsuitable parcel is rejected!

- Dimension (l or b or h) cannot be more than 100cm
- The sum of all dimensions (l + b + h) must not be greater than 300cm.
- The weight must be between 1kg and 10kg (inclusive).
- Output whether the parcel is accepted or rejected.

### Task 2 - Collect the data for many parcels (MEDIUM)

Add a loop so that multiple parcels can be validated. You can ask the user how many parcels need checking. You must keep track of the number of parcels that got rejected and accepted. After all parcels are checked output:

- The total number of parcels inputted.
- The total number of parcels accepted and a percentage.
- The total number of parcels rejected and a percentage.

### Task 3 - Calculate how many candy canes Santa needs to fuel the journey (HARD)

Amend the code in Task 2 so that with each accepted parcel you need to calculate the number of candy canes required to deliver it. Use must use the following rules:

- 1kg to 5kg (inclusive) need 10 candy canes
- Each 100g over 5kg up to 10kg costs one extra candy cane.

## There is a catch...

You probably realised that one task builds on the other so we have to work together if we want to help Santa in time. Are you up for the challenge?

# Teams

For this exercise you can work in small teams of 3, and each member would have a particular role:

| Name        | Role        |
| ----------- | ------------|
|             | Lead        |
|             | Developer   |
|             | Researcher  |

| Name        | Role        |
| ----------- | ------------|
|             | Lead        |
|             | Developer   |
|             | Researcher  |

| Name        | Role        |
| ----------- | ------------|
|             | Lead        |
|             | Developer   |
|             | Researcher  |

| Name        | Role        |
| ----------- | ------------|
|             | Lead        |
|             | Developer   |
|             | Researcher  |

# Reflect on the task and assess your level

Easy - You are getting comfortable with the basics. There is input, output, and simple processing that involves branching. You are on the right track.

Medium - You remembered loops. Which loop did you use? You also know how to keep track of a running total. Great work!

Hard - You have stamina! You also know how to do quite complex expressions in Java. You are defintely ready for the next phase of our journey.
